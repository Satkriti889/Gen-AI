    "At its core, a Large Language Model (LLM) is a sophisticated neural network trained on a massive amount of text data. Think of it as an incredibly powerful \"autocomplete\" system. It learns grammar, facts, reasoning abilities, and different styles of writing by predicting the next word in a sentence, over and over again, on a dataset the size of a large portion of the internet"
